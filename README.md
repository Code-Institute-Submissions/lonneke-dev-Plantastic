Plantastic is an online store that allows the users to purchase specific plants from the comfort of their own home. They can make an account to see what they've bought in the past and to save their details. The user will also be able to sign up for a newsletter and make safe payments using stripe.

This project is my fourth assignment of the Full stack development course I am following at CodeInstitute. This is why the site is slightly limited in functionality, meaning you can't actually make a purchase. If you'd like to test it out you can use the following details for making a payment:
- Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Date: 04/24
- CVC: 242
- Postal code or ZIP: 42424

<h1>1. User experience (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project Goals

<br>

The purpose of this project is to 

*"...build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service"* using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, a relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres), Stripe payments
and possible additional libraries and API's. 

As said by Codeinstitute who i=has assigned this project.

This project has a full set of CRUD (creation, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features. CRUD at user interface level:

|Operation|HTTP|DDS|Description|
|---|----|----|----|
|**Create**|PUT/POST|Write|Create a resource: Users can create profiles by signing up. Users can create orders by adding items to bag and then follow the checkout procedure. Admin can create products and send newsletters.
|**Read**|GET|Read|Retrieve a resource: Users can retrieve, search and view products.
|**Update**|PUT/PATCH/POST|Write|Update a resource: Users can update/edit the delivery information. Admin can update/edit products.
|**Delete**|DELETE|Dispose|Delete a resource: Admin can delete products.

<span id="ux-target"></span>

### 1.2 User target

The target group for plantastic is customers who like plants and want to have specific ones for their own. It is therefor important that the customer/user can have a full overview of the different products the site offers and also be able to easily checkout. It is necessary that no things get in the way of the user, because this will potentially make the owner lose a customer.

<span id="ux-stories"></span>

<span id="ux-design"></span>

### 1.4 Design 
    
- #### Colour Scheme
The colours used throughout this project are shades of green, white and black to keep the visuals simple and clean. This colour scheme has also been choosen to stay in the theme of plants. 

- Green: mostly the "success" colour of Bootstrap 5 to give buttons a clear colour.
- White: To use as background of different parts because of the dark background.
- Black: Mostly used for the text on the white backgrounds for easy readability.

Some red and other colours have been used for the messages shown if something goes wrong or succesfull, to show a good difference between the messages.

- #### Fonts
The **Preahvihear font** is used throughout the whole website for all text. sans serif is the fallback in case the main font isn't being imported to the site correctly. I used this font because it's easy to look at.

- #### Icons
In this project the icons used are provided by [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The icons used have a practical and functional purpose for example the magnifying glass icon for the search box. They also give character to the website.

- #### Images
The images I used for this project came mostly from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/): 
- The background image: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) uploaded by: [Catia Matos](https://www.pexels.com/@catiamatos). 
- All images for the products were taken from: [home-designing](http://www.home-designing.com/best-low-light-indoor-house-plants-for-sale)
- backup image for product without image: [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) uploaded by: [Daria Shevtsova](https://www.pexels.com/@daria)

- #### Interactive design 

    - The website has to be easy to navigate. 
    - The user can quickly find the information he/she wants to find.
